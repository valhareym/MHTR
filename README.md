# ScribbleSense: Multilingual Handwritten Text Recognition

## Introduction
Our project is a cutting-edge Multilingual Handwritten Text Recognition (MHTR) system powered by advanced Machine Learning techniques. Leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), our solution excels in accurately transcribing handwritten text from diverse languages. The CNN architecture enables the model to learn intricate patterns and features inherent in handwritten scripts, making it robust and adaptable to various linguistic styles. Our system goes beyond language barriers, making it a versatile tool for recognizing and converting handwritten documents into machine-readable text. With a focus on precision and scalability, our project aims to revolutionize the way handwritten text is processed, opening up new possibilities for document digitization and language-agnostic text recognition.

## Languages Supported
MHTR extends its recognition capabilities to an array of languages, including but not limited to Devanagari, English, Gujarati, and Arabic. Each language module within the MHTR framework is fine-tuned with specialized datasets and scripts, ensuring optimal recognition accuracy. These datasets are meticulously curated to represent the intricate nuances of each language's script, thus enhancing the model's comprehension and transliteration capabilities.

## Architecture Overview
The CNN architecture, integral to the MHTR model, is elaborated in various documentation and code notebooks. For instance, the Devanagari module's architecture is detailed in Devanagari/devnagiri_handwritten_Char.ipynb. This file provides insights into the convolutional layers, activation functions, and other architectural specifics that empower the model's script recognition efficiency.

## Ensemble Technique
MHTR incorporates a novel ensemble technique, dubbed the "boating technique," which synergistically combines multiple model predictions to boost overall accuracy and performance. This technique involves aggregating outputs from various model instances, each trained on slightly different data variations or architectures, thereby increasing the robustness and reliability of the final prediction.
